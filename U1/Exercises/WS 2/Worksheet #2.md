### 3. The Geometrizer

Calculate properties of a circle, searching the internet for definitions if not remember.

### 4. The Temperature Converter

It's hot out! Let's make a converter, and again you'll have to search the internet how to do it.

- Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
- Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
